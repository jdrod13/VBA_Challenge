# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
    
   **Steve is helping his parents managing their investment's portfolio, and Steve’s parents have decided that they would like to invest all their money in DAQO New Energy Corp. However, Steve wants our help to analyze DAQO’s data of the stock and look for opportunities to diversify their portfolio in other good green energy companies**

### Purpose
     
     
   **The purpose of this work is to analyze the data provided from the different green energy companies provided to create a detailed report with comments and recommendations based on the behaviors of the stock. In addition, Steve wants us to do a little more research for his parents; he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock margin over the past few years.**



## Analysis and Challenges
  
  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on 2017 “All Analysis of Stock.”
      
      
   **The first action on this analysis was making sure that all the data was formatted adequately without any errors. Second, we extracted the data and formulated the proper table. It was necessary to make sure that our excel workbook was active on the VBA code scrip in an adequate runway. Then, we created a set of loops to get the appropriate analysis running with our code and ultimately get the expected results to display in our excel worksheet. Also, it was essential to making sure that the interactive macro box was running adequately and showing the right pop-up messages for each action. As far as our first outcome after running our VBA code, we can now examine the table displayed based on our criteria; there is a table on the picture attached below that represents that represents the stock name total daily volume and the percentage return filled with green color for positive return and red for negative percentage return.**

## Results
  
  
  ### 2017 All Stocks Analysis
       
       
   **From the tables previously displayed in 2017 was a positive year for the industry green energy sector. It is relevant to point out that some stocks from the green industry listed on our analysis surpassed the line of hundred percent plus the percentage of return; here with the highlight a list of our leading gainers for the 2017 year we had: DQ- +199.4%, SEDG- +184.5%, ENPH- +129.5% and FSLR- +101.3%. In conclusion, 2017 All Stock Analysis demonstrated a positive relationship with Capital of investment and Return of investment.** 


   
   ### 2018 All Stocks Analysis 
        
  
  **By contrast, for our findings in 2018 from the tables previously displayed about 2018 stocks, we found negative results for return of investment in the green industry companies. It is relevant to point out that most of the stocks listed in our analysis had a negative behavior for their returns. We can highlight just two companies with positive returns for the 2018 year, and these companies are ENPH- +81.9% AND run- +84%. In conclusion, 2018 All Stock Analysis demonstrated a negative behavior in relationship with Capital of investment and Return of investment by the exception of two companies that represented a positive percentage of return (ENPH stock and RUN stock).**

 
 
 
 
  ### Recommendations
  
  **Based on our analysis of all stocks in the green energy industry sector for  2017 and 2018. We recommend making diversified and low-risk investment actions based on the most promising and fast-paced growing companies from the listed stocks. Our analysis demonstrated a high downfall in percentages of return for the last year compared to the return of investment in the previous year.**


**The gained line chart gives us an accurate representation of our highest successful theater event between May and June with a quantity of 111-100 successful events. The lowest amount of successful theater events was in December, with 37. The line graph also represents the relationship between successful, failed, and canceled events over different months. On the other hand, from the Outcome-based on goal-line chart, we got results based on the criteria selected for this particular that demonstrates that the percentage failed from the outcomes based on goal dominated over the portion of successful events.**

 
 ### Summary

-	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

**This report is a detailed representation that demonstrates refactoring as an advantage because we can display interactive, accurate results while saving time coding our scrip instead of manually analyzing and applying formulas on excel.**


-	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original script?

**This refactoring pros use to our original scrip by editing the actual code to analyze and find the results of the new set of criteria implemented to have the opportunity of choosing the year that you would display between 2017 and 2018 than just getting the works for 2018.**
